    <string name="tutorial_nospeed">This tweak will make Android Auto think that the car is at 0 speed. As a result, Android Auto will always
    show the preview of messages. This tweak does not apply to keyboard or first configuration of Android Auto.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_sixtap">This tweak will override the 6 tap limit of Android Auto and will make unlimited browsing of content always possible.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_shortcuts">This tweak will unlock the new Assistant Shortcuts feature. Once activated you can go in Android Auto settings, and in the customize launcher
    section you can start adding shortcuts to Google Assistant commands</string>
    <string name="tutorial_startup">This tweak will override the default behaviour of Android Auto opening a navigation app at start and will make Android Auto start on launcher. This
    tweak could occasionally fail because sometimes Android Auto starts with a navigation to home or work autonomously and this behaviour
    breaks the tweak. IT\'S NOT POSSIBLE TO SET A SPECIFIC APP TO START.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_widescreen">This tweak will force Android Auto in widescreen mode.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_bluetooth">BETA This tweak should prevent Bluetooth from turning on when Android Auto is connected. This tweak
    won\'t work if Bluetooth is already on, and currently it is in beta.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_patchapps">This tweak will enable third-party apps made specifically with Android Auto custom SDK to work on Android Auto. If you are familiar with AA Phenotype Patcher, this tweak is pretty much identical. It\'s not possible to add just any app to Android Auto, but it\'s possible to patch sideloaded apps MADE FOR ANDROID AUTO to work in cars.</string>
